# 0x03 Shell Variables, Expansions, and Environment

## Overview

This repository contains Bash scripts designed to practice and demonstrate mastery of **shell variables**, **environment variables**, **aliases**, and basic **arithmetic operations** in a Linux shell environment. These scripts are part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum and cover tasks from creating aliases to performing operations on environment variables.

If you want, I can also make a **shorter, compact version** suitable for GitHub that fits perfectly at the root of the repo without being too verbose but still professional.  

Do you want me to make that version too?
